title: Not The Tab Groups, Firefox!

I'm dismayed to see that tab-groups is scheduled to be removed from Firefox (announcement
[here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-removal)). It's one of my favorite Firefox features and a big
reason I don't use Chrome, the other being support for privacy in the [Mozilla
Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). I always have a pile of tab-groups open:

The good news is that in the [announcement](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-removal), Mozilla includes a
link to the new [tab-groups](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/) add-on, which will
work pretty much like the existing functionality. Install it. Live it. Get your tab-groups on!


Pro-Tip: Keep a list of your add-ons in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) gist, [like
this](https://gist.github.com/kpb/705f570cacace23893c5).
